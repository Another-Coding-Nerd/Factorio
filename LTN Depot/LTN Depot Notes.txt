Pre-Reqs
-Knowledge of LTN is assumed
-Do yourself a favor and have filter inserters on your Requestor/Provider Stations

Features
-12 LTN Depots in a compact form
-Configurable train setups up to length 10 (ex: A 1-4-1 train is length 6)
-Auto refueling of locos
-Auto unloading of remaining cargo
-Auto holds trains at depot while cargo present

Usage + Options
-Downgrade belts/inserts as needed in the early-ish game (protip: apply an upgrade planner to the BP)
-Typically the #3 Fuel In belt is fed by an LTN Requestor Station
-The #4 Cargo Out belt should feed an LTN Provider Station set to priority. Adjust request/provide limits to your needs.
-Optionally you can add a train stacker in front of the #1 Train Entrance but generally a second depot is a better choice.

Deep Thoughts
-If setup as outlined above, you can have a handy tool to add extra inventory to the train provider network. Say you are at an LTN station and you just cleared a mass of trees. Place them into the spare cargo slots of the train before it leaves. It'll get emptied at the depot and make it's way down to the overflow Provider Station (#4 Cargo Out belt) and be available for train requests!
-The #5 Loco Config Bank Constant Combinator work as follows. When a locomotive signal is set for a given position, the inserter to load fuel into the loco is enabbled. Otherwise the other inserter is enabled to unload cargo.
-There is almost never a need to have the 1st Loco Config Constant Combinator disabled. (More about Loco Configuration elsewhere) The first car in the train is always a Loco. However I wanted some consistency in the layout. If you were switching fuel types, you could disable all Loco Config CC's and it would empty the old fuel. Then re-enable per your train setup to refuel with the new fuel type.

BP Quick Setup
-Downgrade Belts/Inserters if needed
-Lay down the BP and quickly check several items
	- All LTN Stations are named 'Depot'
	- The #6 Depot signal is enabled and sending out a Depot Signal. It should look like this:
	- The #5 Loco Config Bank Constant Combinator are all disabled except for the rightmost unit (closest to the LTN Station)

Loco Configuration

Now it's time to plug-in you train setup. It's easier that you think! For each position where you'll have a locomotive, enable the loco signal on the corresponding constant combinator.


To-Do/Future
-Expand to a 12x12 setup (to support 2-8-2 trains) and test
